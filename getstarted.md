Mentored Sprints was started as an initiative to onboard and empower folks from historically underrepresented groups in open source. You can learn more about our mission here:

[Mentored Sprints](https://www.mentored-sprints.dev/about/)

We love seeing folks organising their own mentored sprints as part of conferences and as stand-alone events.

## What you need to know

- All of our content including the Community handbook are entirely Open Source (we release code under a BSD-3 license and content/art under CC-BY).
- The Community handbook contains useful resources to run your own online sprints [Check the Community Handbook here](https://mentored-sprints.netlify.app/).
- This is community-led project run by volunteers.

### Requirements

We have some basic requirement to ensure your event lines up with our ethos:

1. You **must**  have a Code of Conduct, whether you have one for your specific event or adapt the Mentored Sprints. **This is a hard requirement**.
2. You **must** have clear Code of Conduct enforcement guidelines and reporting mechanisms. Including a named person responsible for CoC incidents handling on the day.
3. We at Mentored Sprints prioritise folks from underrepresented groups and newcomers to open source - we would like to encourage you to follow this approach. We know this can be problematic, another approach we follow is: "each participating person from a majoritarian group should bring another individual from a marginalised group"
4. Fill in a very brief impact report after your event - this helps us keep track of the impact of Mentored Sprints and learn what we can do better.
